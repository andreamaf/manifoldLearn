The present module manifoldLearn implements in Python programming language
various algorithms performing nonlinear dimensionality reduction and so-called 
spectral clustering, based on a geometrically inspired and locality preserving
criterion, particularly suited for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold
embedded in a high-dimensional space.
NB Isomap algorithm in [1] is the only one pursuing a global optimal solution
   for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
